# tech-stacts

#This is something that I'm playing with to renew my skills and pull some interesting data.
#The intent is to pull some statistics from some repos for metrics like:
#   languages that are in the repos
#   number of lines of code per language
#   % of code per language (calculated as (# lines of code in language-x / total lines of code * 100)
#   number of code changes per language 
#   number of code changes per language as % of all changes
